# orthogonal
Orthogonal is a javascript helper library. It's main selling point is as a dependency injector/manager. It's pretty smart about lazy-loading injected dependencies, and provides a pretty clean interface. Check the code for usage.

Orthogonal is not under active development or use right now, but feel free to fork and update.
